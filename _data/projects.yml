  subtitle: Song Guessing Game built over Winter Break to Learn More Backend Web Development.
  date: Winter 2019
  description: "I love listening to music and so do my friends. Now and then we would play a game where 
    we would shuffle a playlist on Spotify and see who could guess the song first. I decided to learn backend 
    web development by creating a web version of the game we had been playing mechanically. I learned Node.js and 
    how to work with the Spotify Web API to build <i>Guess The Song</i>. The game requires the user to sign into 
    a premium Spotify account. The user will then decide which playlist to play with and which device they would like 
    to listen on. </br></br>There are two game modes to try: (1) Time Challenge - The user has 60 seconds to score as many 
    points as they can. Points are awarded based on how fast the correct answer is chosen. An incorrect choice will 
    subtract 5 seconds. (2) Classic Mode - The user can see how long they can last before they lose all three lives. 
    Each song will play for 5 seconds before a life is lost.</br></br>I hope to have the game playable online soon.The 
    code can be viewed <a href='https://github.com/alorber/Guess-The-Song'><i>here</i></a>."

  subtitle: Logic Game Built Using CMOS Logic Chips for my Digital Logic Design Final Project
  date: Fall 2018
  description: "The final project for Digital Logic Design required each group of 2 students to fully design 
    and build a project of their choosing (once the professor approved it) using CMOS logic chips and breadboards. 
    The project my partner and I built is a logic puzzle / maze.</br></br>The game plays as follows: The goal 
    is to reach the specified ending position from the specified starting position by stepping on each 'tile' 
    on an 8x8 matrix of LEDs once and only once. If the player goes over a 'tile' that has already been stepped 
    on, then the player will lose. Since it is possible to have an unplayable board if randomly generated, 4 easy 
    boards and 4 hard boards were created. The player can select the difficulty and one of the 4 board from the 
    selected group will be randomly chosen.</br></br>My documentation for the project, including a schematic diagram 
    of the circuit, can be viewed <a href="##">here</a>."

  subtitle: Traffic Light Built Using CMOS Logic Chips for a Digital Logic Design Project
  date: Fall 2018
  description: "The purpose of this project was to simulate a 4-way traffic light using CMOS logic chips and 
    breadboards. The traffic light included: red, yellow, and green LEDs for all 4 directions; green and yellow turn 
    signals for East and West; a display counting down the seconds left for the green light (time left for pedestrians 
    to cross); a pedestrian button to shorten the green light to 5 seconds.</br></br>My documentation for the project, 
    including a schematic diagram of the circuit, can be viewed <a href="##">here</a>. "
