- name: Checkers AI
  subtitle: Artificial Intelligence That Plays Checkers
  date: Fall 2019
  description: 'The first project in my Artificial Intelligence course was to build the game of checkers and 
  an AI to play against the user. I built the game with an ASCII interface, allowing the user to select from 
  multiple options and game modes. The user can begin a new game or import a custom board, the user can either 
  play against the AI or have the AI play itself, the user can decide how long the AI has to move, and the user 
  can decide the starting player. The AI was implemented by a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning and 
  iterative deepening. I developed and thoroughly tested the heuristic that the AI uses by having the AI play 
  against itself with different heuristics, tweaking the one that lost.<br><br>The code for the project can be 
  found <i><a href="https://github.com/alorber/AI-Checkers">here</a></i> on my github.<br><br>The write-up for the 
  project, describing my implementation in more detail, can be read 
  <i><a href="assets/pdf/AI_Project_1_Writeup.pdf">here</a></i>.'

- name: Sorting Algorithm
  subtitle: Sorting Algorithm for a <i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i> Project
  date: Spring 2019
  description: 'The aim of this project was to develop a single sorting algorithm that would sort four different 
    linked lists the fastest. Each node of the linked lists contained a last name, first name, and social security 
    number (Each ssn was guaranteed to be unique). The four linked lists the program was graded on were not given 
    before submission, but were described as:<br><br>1) "Approximately (within 1 percent of) 100,000 data objects. 
    Each data object will store a randomly selected last name, a randomly selected first name, and a randomly generated 
    social security number."<br>2) "Approximately (within 1 percent of) 1,000,000 data objects. Each data object 
    will store a randomly selected last name, a randomly selected first name, and a randomly generated social security 
    number."<br>3) "The same data objects as #2, but they have already been sorted according to last names and 
    first names (but not according to social security numbers)."<br>4) "Approximately (within 1 percent of) 
    1,000,000 data objects. Each data object will store the same last name and the same first name (both 
    selected randomly, but only once), and a randomly generated social security number."<br><br>My code for the assignment 
    can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/alorber/DSA-Sorting/tree/master"><i>here</i></a>.'

- name: Stacks & Queues
  subtitle: Implementation of a Stack & Queue for a <i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i> Project
  date: Spring 2019
  description: 'The aim of this project was to develop a program that would use data structures to implement 
  a stack and queue. The program would ask the user for an input and output file and then process each instruction 
  in the input file. The possible instructions are:<br><br>1) Create <i>(name) (stack/queue)</i>: A stack or queue with the specified 
  name should be created. If it has already been created, the program should throw an error.<br>2) Push <i>(name) 
  (value)</i>: The value should be pushed to the specified stack or queue. If it does not exist then the program will 
  throw an error.<br>3) Pop <i>(name)</i>: Pops a value from the specified stack or queue. If it does not exist then the 
  program will throw an error.<br><br>My code for the assignment can be viewed

- name: Guess The Song
  subtitle: Song Guessing Game using the Spotify Web API
  date: Winter 2019
  description: 'I love listening to music and so do my friends. Now and then we would play a game where 
    we would shuffle a playlist on Spotify and see who could guess the song first. I decided to learn backend 
    web development by creating a web version of the game we had been playing mechanically. I learned Node.js and 
    how to work with the Spotify Web API to build <i>Guess The Song</i>. The game requires the user to sign into 
    a premium Spotify account. The user will then decide which playlist to play with and which device they would like 
    to listen on. <br><br>There are two game modes to try: (1) Time Challenge - The user has 60 seconds to score as many 
    points as they can. Points are awarded based on how fast the correct answer is chosen. An incorrect choice will 
    subtract 5 seconds. (2) Classic Mode - The user can see how long they can last before they lose all three lives. 
    Each song will play for 5 seconds before a life is lost.<br><br>I hope to have the game playable online soon. The 
    code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/alorber/Guess-The-Song"><i>here</i></a>.'

- name: Don't Break The Ice
  subtitle: Logic Game Built Using CMOS Logic Chips for my <i>Digital Logic Design</i> Final Project
  date: Fall 2018
  description: 'The final project for Digital Logic Design required each group of 2 students to fully design 
    and build a project of their choosing (once the professor approved it) using CMOS logic chips and breadboards. 
    The project my partner and I built is a logic puzzle / maze.<br><br>The game plays as follows: The goal 
    is to reach the specified ending position from the specified starting position by stepping on each "tile" 
    on an 8x8 matrix of LEDs once and only once. If the player goes over a "tile" that has already been stepped 
    on, then the player will lose. Since it is possible to have an unplayable board if randomly generated, 4 easy 
    boards and 4 hard boards were created. The player can select the difficulty and one of the 4 board from the 
    selected group will be randomly chosen.<br><br>My documentation for the project, including a schematic diagram 
    of the circuit, can be viewed <a href="assets/pdf/DBTI_Writeup.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>Videos of the project can

  subtitle: Traffic Light Built Using CMOS Logic Chips for a <i>Digital Logic Design</i> Project
  date: Fall 2018
  description: 'The purpose of this project was to simulate a 4-way traffic light using CMOS logic chips and 
    breadboards. The traffic light included: red, yellow, and green LEDs for all 4 directions; green and yellow turn 
    signals for East and West; a display counting down the seconds left for the green light (time left for pedestrians 
    to cross); a pedestrian button to shorten the green light to 5 seconds.<br><br>My documentation for the project,

- name: Ramaz Artist Project
  subtitle: Website for High School Art Project
  date: Spring 2017
  description: 'The Ramaz Artist Project was my first experience with web development. During my senior year of 
    high school, one of my teachers asked me if I would like to build a website for a school art project. Realizing 
    the opportunity to learn something new, I immediately agreed. I spent a few weeks watching videos online, which 
    taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; The rest I learned as I worked on the website.<br><br> The 
    official description of the project is: <i>The Ramaz Artist Project is an online video series created as a homage 
    to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s own Artist Project, in which contemporary artists from around the world explore 
    and engage with its renowned collection. The Ramaz Artist Project follows twelve senior studio art students as they 
    vocalize their relationships with the very same body of work.</i><br><br>This project was a great learning 
    experience and the website can be found <a href="http://artistproject.ramaz.org/index.html">here</a>.'
