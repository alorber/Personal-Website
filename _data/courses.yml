- name: Artificial Intelligence
  grade: Fall 2019
  description: "This course covers many subtopics of AI, focusing on a few important subtopics in detail. 
    The 'intelligent agent' approach is explained and forms a foundation for the rest of the course. 
    Intelligent search: uninformedsearch, depth-first search, breadth-first search, iterative deepening; 
    informed search, best-first search, A*, heuristics, hill climbing; constraint satisfaction problems; 
    intelligent gameplaying, minimax search, alpha-betapruning. Machine learning: probability, Bayesian 
    learning; decision trees; statistical machine learning, neural networks, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, 
    support vector machines. Natural language processing: syntax, semantics and pragmatics; real-world knowledge; 
    parsing; statistical NLP. Philosophy of AI: AI and consciousness, the Turing test, the Chinese room experiment."
