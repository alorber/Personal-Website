        <p>During my senior year of high school, I took my first programming course, <i>AP Computer Science</i>, and I was hooked. The <i>AP Computer Science</i> course is in Java and the curriculum can be viewed <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course">here</a>. The course consisted of watching videos at home to learn the material and reviewing in class. The units of videos were released monthly and I would complete each month's work within the first few days. My teacher would give me other work to do, mainly consisting of <a href="https://projecteuler.net"><i>Project Euler</i></a>, that would allow me to learn more and practice the skills I had already learned.</p>

        <p></br>Later that year, my teacher asked me if I would like to build a website for a school art project. I agreed and spent time teaching myself web development through online resources. I used my newly acquired skills to create a website for <i>The Ramaz Artist Project</i>. It was a great learning experience and my first attempt at web development.</br></p>

        <p>That summer I interned at <a href="https://www.key.me"><i>KeyMe</i></a> as a front-end developer. I worked on interesting projects consisting of revamping the shopping cart navigation, creating an end-to-end easter egg coupon experience, and more. I learned a lot, including <i>git</i> and <i>Vue</i>, and it was a great experience working there. </p>

        <p>During the winter break of my freshman year, I decided to learn more backend development. I taught myself <i><span>Node.js</span></i> and used it along with the Spotify Web API to build a song guessing game that I had previously played mechanically with friends. The source code can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/alorber/Guess-The-Song"><i>my GitHub</i></a> and I hope to have it runnning online soon. You can read about the project <a href="../projects"><i>here</i></a>.</p>

        <p>This summer, before my sophomore year, I am be working at <a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem"><i>The Cooper Union Summer STEM program</i></a> as a teaching assistant. I, along with three others, developed a six week curriculum to teach twenty-four high school students with no previous programming experience web application development. Throughout the program, I have created presentations and 
        taught classes on a range of topics, including JavaScript, React, Firebase, HTML, & CSS. Class time is spent 
        teaching or assisting the six groups of students in designing and creating their web applications that 
        will support one of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. In order to teach something, one has to truly understand it. This experience has allowed me to learn more, master the fundamentals, and assist a 
        new group of students in building an interest in computer science.

I enjoy trivia and logic puzzles; I can be found playing minesweeper or doing crossword puzzles on the subway and watching Jeopardy at home. And I am also a second degree black-belt in taekwondo.</p>
