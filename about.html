        <p>During my senior year of high school, I took my first programming course, <i>AP Computer Science</i>, and I was hooked. The <i>AP Computer Science</i> course is in Java and the curriculum can be viewed <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course">here</a>. The course consisted of watching videos at home to learn the material and reviewing in class. The units of videos were released monthly and I would complete each month's work within the first few days. My teacher would give me other work to do, mainly consisting of <a href="https://projecteuler.net"><i>Project Euler</i></a>, that would allow me to learn more and practice the skills I had already learned.</p>

        <p></br>Later that year, my teacher asked me if I would like to build a website for a school art project. I agreed and spent time teaching myself web development through online resources. I used my newly acquired skills to create a website for <i>The Ramaz Artist Project</i>. It was a great learning experience and my first attempt at web development.</br></p>

        <p>That summer I interned at <a href="https://www.key.me"><i>KeyMe</i></a> as a front-end developer. I worked on interesting projects consisting of revamping the shopping cart navigation, creating an end-to-end easter egg coupon experience, and more. I learned a lot, including <i>git</i> and <i>Vue</i>, and it was a great experience working there. </p>

        <p> At Cooper Union I am heavily involved in Hillel, the Jewish club on campus. Hillel promotes Jewish culture and holds events for anyone interested in attending. I joined Hillel as the Event Coordinator from Fall 2019 - Fall 2020. As Event Coordinator I managed the logistics to ensure that monthly events ran smoothly for over thirty students and I collaborated with board members to determine a road-map for the semesterâ€™s event programming. Currently, since Fall 2020, I am the club's Vice President and I work with the club's President to lead monthly meetings, finalize event details, and ensure all club programs are properly managed. </p>

        <p>During the winter break of my freshman year, I decided to learn more backend development. I taught myself <i><span>Node.js</span></i> and used it along with the Spotify Web API to build a song guessing game that I had previously played mechanically with friends. The source code can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/alorber/Guess-The-Song"><i>my GitHub</i></a>. You can read about the project <a href="/projects.html"><i>here</i></a>.</p>

        <p>Last summer (2019), I worked at <a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem"><i>The Cooper Union Summer STEM program</i></a> as a teaching assistant for the <i>Computer Science for Social Good</i> course. I, along with three others, developed a six week curriculum to teach twenty-four high school students with no previous programming experience web application development. Throughout the program, I created presentations and taught classes on a range of topics, including JavaScript, React, Firebase, HTML, & CSS. Class time was spent teaching or assisting the six groups of students in designing and creating their web applications that supported one of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. In order to teach something, one has to truly understand it. This experience has allowed me to learn more, master the fundamentals, and assist a new group of students in building an interest in computer science.

        <p>This summer (2020), I returned to <a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem"><i>The Cooper Union Summer STEM program</i></a> as a teaching assistant for the <i>Robotics Crash Course</i>. Due to COVID, the usual six-week course was divided into two three-week sessions of roughly twenty high-schoolers to allow more students to participate. Throughout the course, I, along with three others, directed the students in assembling a car containing an arduino and various sensors and taught the students the necessary software skills in order to program the robot to avoid obstacles. I created presentations and taught classes on Git, GitHub, and various topics in C++. While teaching over video-chat had its challenges, it has been a rewarding experience; I, along with my coworkers, were able to cause students who began the course with no engineering experience to complete the course interested in entering the field. Teaching this course allowed me to review the fundamentals of arduino and C++, while researching new topics in order to answer difficult questions asked by students. 
        </br></br>These past two summers of teaching have helped me develop important skills: communication, organization, public speaking, leadership, and many more.
